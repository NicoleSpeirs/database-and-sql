1. How do you find related data held in two separate data tables?

    We use JOIN statements.

2. Explain, in your own words, the difference between an INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, and RIGHT OUTER JOIN. Give a real-world example for each.

INNER JOIN will return all data in rows that are common between both tables with a matching foreign key. For example, a rental complex needs a list with all current tenants and the current price of their apartment unit.

LEFT OUTER JOIN will return all data from the left table, and any matching data from right table. If the right table has no matching data it will return NULL. For example if a rental complex needs a list of all of the tenants names and apt number for current tenants.

RIGHT OUTER JOIN will return all data from the right table, and any matching data on the left table. If the left table has no matching data it will return NULL. For example the apartment complex wants a list of all the available and accupied units with a list of names next to the accupied units.


3. Define primary key and foreign key. Give a real-world example for each.

  Primary key has a unique identifier and can only be used one time per table such as; person's social security number or ID number.
  Foreign key is a primary key in another table that can be used to join two tables such as; child's table will include foreign key "parent_id" that connects to the primary key on the patent's table.

4. Define aliasing.

  A technique of creating a short variable names instead of a full table name.

5. Change this query so that you are using aliasing:

    SELECT professor.name, compensation.salary,
    compensation.vacation_days
    FROM professor
    JOIN compensation ON professor.id =
    compensation.professor_id;

    SELECT p.name, c.salary, c.vacation_days
    FROM professor AS p
    JOIN compensation AS c ON p.id = c.professor_id;

6. Why would you use a NATURAL JOIN? Give a real-world example.

  By using a NATURAL JOIN we can retrieve a table list of all matching columns of two other tables. If we want to all of the information from our parent's tables.

7. Using this Employee schema and data, write queries to find the following information:

 List all employees and all shifts.

  SELECT e.name, e.id, s.date, s.start_time, s.end_time
  FROM employees AS e
  LEFT JOIN scheduled_shifts AS ss ON e.id = ss.employee_id
  LEFT JOIN shifts AS s ON s.id = ss.shift_id;


8. Using this Adoption schema and data, please write queries to retrieve the following information and include the results:

  Create a list of all volunteers. If the volunteer is fostering a dog, include each dog as well.

    SELECT volunteers.first_name, volunteers.last_name, dogs.name
    FROM volunteers
    LEFT OUTER JOIN dogs
    ON volunteers.foster_dog_id = dogs.id;

    first_name	  last_name	     dog_name
    Rubeus	      Hagrid	      Munchkin
    Marjorie	    Dursley	      Marmaduke
    Sirius	      Black	         null
    Remus	        Lupin	         null
    Albus	        Dumbledore	   null


  The cat's name, adopter's name, and adopted date for each cat adopted within the past month to be displayed as part of the "Happy Tail" social media promotion which posts recent successful adoptions.

    SELECT
    cats.name AS "Cat Name",
    concat (adopters.first_name, ' ',
    adopters.last_name) AS "Adopter Full Name",
    cat_adoptions.date AS "Adoption Date"
    FROM cat_adoptions
    JOIN cats
      ON cat_adoptions.cat_id = cats.id
    JOIN adopters
      ON cat_adoptions.adopter_id = adopters.id
    WHERE cat_adoptions.date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 DAYS';


    Cat Name	  Adopter Full Name	      Adoption Date
    Mushi	      Arabella Figg	          2019-05-14T00:00:00.000Z
    Victoire	  Argus Filch	            2019-05-19T00:00:00.000Z



  Create a list of adopters who have not yet chosen a dog to adopt.

    SELECT
    concat (adopters.first_name, ' ',
        adopters.last_name) AS "Adopter Full Name"
    FROM adopters
    LEFT OUTER JOIN dog_adoptions
      ON adopters.id = dog_adoptions.adopter_id
    WHERE dog_id is NULL;

  Lists of all cats and all dogs who have not been adopted.

    SELECT
    concat (cats.name, ' ',' (ID: ', cats.id, ')')AS "Available Pets"
    FROM cats

      ON cats.id = cat_adoptions.cat_id
    WHERE cat_adoptions.cat_id is NULL
    UNION
    SELECT
    concat (dogs.name, ' ', ' (ID: ', dogs.id, ')')AS "Available Pets"
    FROM dogs
    LEFT OUTER JOIN dog_adoptions
      ON dogs.id = dog_adoptions.dog_id
    WHERE dog_adoptions.dog_id is NULL;


      Available Pets
      Boujee (ID: 10001)
      Lassie (ID: 10003)

  The name of the person who adopted Rosco.

    SELECT
    concat (adopters.first_name, ' ',
            adopters.last_name) AS "Adopter Full Name", dogs.name AS "Adopted Dog Name"
    FROM dog_adoptions
    JOIN adopters
      ON adopters.id = dog_adoptions.adopter_id

9. Using this Library schema and data, write queries applying the following scenarios and include the results:

  To determine if the library should buy more copies of a given book, please provide the names and position, in order, of all of the patrons with a hold (request for a book with all copies checked out) on "Advanced Potion-Making".

    SELECT patrons.name, holds.rank
    FROM holds
    JOIN patrons
      ON patrons.id =holds.patron_id

    Terry Boot	      1
    Cedric Diggory	  2

  List all of the library patrons. If they have one or more books checked out, list the books with the patrons.

    SELECT DISTINCT patrons.name,
      (SELECT b.title
